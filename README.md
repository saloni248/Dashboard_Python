# Imports and Exports Data Dashboard

## Overview
The Imports and Exports Data Dashboard is an interactive web application built using Streamlit. It provides insights into import and export transactions through various visualizations, helping users analyze patterns and trends in their data.

## Features
- **Data Visualization**: The dashboard includes multiple visualizations, such as bar charts, pie charts, treemaps, and bubble charts, to present different aspects of the data effectively.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Users can filter the data based on categories and shipping methods to refine their analysis.
- **Customer Insights**: The dashboard showcases customer-wise transactions, allowing users to identify their top customers for imports and exports.
- **Correlation Analysis**: A heatmap is included to visualize correlations between numerical features in the dataset.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: A library based on Matplotlib for creating informative statistical graphics.
- **Plotly**: A library for creating interactive plots and dashboards.
- **Streamlit**: An open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.

## Installation
To run the dashboard locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Dataset
The dashboard uses a CSV dataset named `Imports_Exports_Dataset.csv`. The dataset should contain the following columns:
- `Category`: The category of the product.
- `Customer`: The name of the customer.
- `Import_Export`: Indicates whether the transaction is an 'Import' or 'Export'.
- `Shipping_Method`: The method used for shipping the transaction.
- `Value`: The transaction value in USD.
- `Quantity`: The quantity of items involved in the transaction.
- `Weight`: The weight of the shipment.

Ensure the dataset is located in the same directory as the application script.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can use the sidebar to filter the data by:
- Categories
- Shipping Methods

The dashboard will dynamically update the visualizations based on the selected filters.
